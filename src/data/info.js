There are cases in which the Sorting Hat receives students who make it doubt which house they should be assigned to.

Students of this house spend most of their time in Gryffindor Tower, located on the seventh floor of Hogwarts Castle."

Initially, Hufflepuff sought students who simply wanted to belong to that house, although nowadays it seeks loyal, honest students who are not afraid of hard work. The founder is none other than the witch Helga Hufflepuff, a childhood friend of Rowena Ravenclaw. Helga was a very noble, friendly witch and the main driving force behind Hogwarts accepting Muggle-born students. The main relic of the house is Helga Hufflepuff's cup. The symbol of the house is a black badger and its representative colors are yellow and charcoal black."

Ravenclaw seeks creative, curious students who always look for the answer. It was founded by the witch, born in the glens of Scotland, Rowena Ravenclaw. She is supposedly the main inventor of the name, location and format of Hogwarts. She is also the cause of the stairs moving. Her main relic is Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem.

            description: `Slytherin House is characterized primarily by ambition and cunning. It was founded by the wizard Salazar Slytherin. The Common Room is located in the dungeons, passing through a series of numerous underground passages. Possibly it is reached through the Hogwarts Hall. Specifically it is located under the Black Lake, making the common room cold and with a greenish hue, since there are windows that look out onto the waters. It is accessed through a highly concealed door in a stone wall, saying a password required. The only known one is "Pureblood". Its main relic is Salazar Slytherin's locket. The representative animal is the snake, its colors are green and silver and the element is water, associated with cunning and coldness.`
